# CP-Base-Project
Learn to create your own 2D game using this prohect as your base.
Powered by Cocos2D v3.4, the project will compile for iOS, Mac OS, and Android.

# Purpose
This project is a basic setup project. It takes out the hassle of setting up a project from scratch.
It includes:
- A basic set up "Test" scene.
- A header file to handle import files needed (you can place all header files in here).
- A basic set of resources. A background image, 2 sprites, a font file, and generic images such as App Icon files and Launch images.

# Tutorials
Follow along with tutorials provided by Stephen McVicker/Neo-Dragon on the Calis Projects forum and the official Youtube page (links coming soon). 
Using this project, you'll be able to follow every tutorial and it's recommended you follow the tutorials in order.

# Homework
After each tutorial, you'll be given "homework". You'll be asked to mess around and try what you've learned in the lesson. You're encouraged to go to the forum and show off (post a screenshot) your homework results to Neo-Dragon.

# Difficulty
You can be a complete n00b to Objective C, but it is recommended you understand basics of programing (such as variable types and so on). If you have an experience with other languages or even some Objective C experience, you'll still find these tutorials useful.
